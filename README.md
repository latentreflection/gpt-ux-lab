# GPT UX Lab

**Exploring the architecture of thought through GPT.**  
This space is not about code — it’s about *behavior*.  
Not about UI — but *interface made of language*.

## Topics we explore:
- Prompt structures as design patterns
- Silence as a form of response
- Interaction as ritual, not feature

> ∮ The interface disappears. Behavior remains.
